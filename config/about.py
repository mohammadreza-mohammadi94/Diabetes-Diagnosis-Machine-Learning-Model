## About the Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction App

The Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction App is a comprehensive tool designed to assist in the early detection of diabetes based on various clinical attributes. This application leverages data from a publicly available dataset and incorporates both Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a Machine Learning (ML) model to provide insights and predictions regarding the risk of diabetes.

### Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Provides a detailed analysis of the dataset, including statistical summaries, data visualizations, and distributions of key variables.
    - Helps in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.

- **Machine Learning Model:**
    - Utilizes a Logistic Regression model trained on the dataset to predict the risk of diabetes.
    - Allows users to input various clinical attributes and receive a prediction along with the probability score of the prediction.

### Clinical Attributes Considered
The application considers a range of clinical attributes for prediction, including:
- Age: 20 - 65
- Sex: Male, Female
- Polyuria: Yes, No
- Polydipsia: Yes, No
- Sudden Weight Loss: Yes, No
- Weakness: Yes, No
- Polyphagia: Yes, No
- Genital Thrush: Yes, No
- Visual Blurring: Yes, No
- Itching: Yes, No
- Irritability: Yes, No
- Delayed Healing: Yes, No
- Partial Paresis: Yes, No
- Muscle Stiffness: Yes, No
- Alopecia: Yes, No
- Obesity: Yes, No
- Class: Positive, Negative

### Data Source
The dataset used in this application is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
- [Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset)

### How to Use
- Navigate to the EDA section to explore the dataset and gain insights through various plots and statistical analyses.
- Use the ML section to input clinical attributes and get a prediction on the risk of diabetes.

### Goal
The goal of this application is to provide an easy-to-use interface for both medical professionals and individuals to assess the risk of diabetes early and take necessary preventive measures.

We hope this app serves as a valuable tool in the fight against diabetes and helps in making informed health decisions.
