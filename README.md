# Diabetes Diagnosis Machine Learning Model

This project focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning model to diagnose diabetes based on patient data.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific medical measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.


## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammadreza-mohammadi94/Diabetes_Diagnosis_Machine_Learning_Model.git
    cd Diabetes_Diagnosis_Machine_Learning_Model
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Diabetes_Diagnosis_Model.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the notebook cells to load the data, preprocess it, build and evaluate the machine learning model.

## Model

The model uses various classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
